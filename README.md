# Yr-4-Project
A collection of scripts used in Yr4 project work.

The file 'TDE-light_curve_first' shows a plot for the TDE AT2019qiz. This was used to illustrate the expected shape of a TDE's light curve using data supplied by Matt (project supervisor).

The file 'columnreader_AT2019mha' was used to reformat the data for the TDE AT2019mha from a text file into a CDS table. The first section of the code removes all the spacing from the files by replacing them with a commas and then removing thec ommas (this must be iterated through a few times to remove all irregularities).
The second part of the code slices into the previous data file and rewrites a new file with the desired format.
